The Elevation Visualizer allows users to enter a starting address and a destination in order to receive visual feedback on the actual elevation that will be encountered while driving along the route. Users can see, in great detail, the actual peaks and valleys of a specific road by clicking on the box containing that part of the directions. 

This app could be used to to anticipate what type of inclines/declines the user may have to deal with when planning a trip. It is also interesting to be able to see what is basically a 'side view' of roads the user may use on a day to day basis.
